# Install Mathesar via Docker Compose

## Requirements

- You need **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)**.

    We've tested with Docker v23 and Docker Compose v2.10. Older versions may not work.

- You need **root access**.

- If using a custom domain name

    Have your domain name ready during the installation process and have your DNS pointing to your Mathesar server.

- If connecting to an existing database

    - Ensure the external database can accept network connections from your Mathesar server.
    - Have the following information handy before installation:

        - Database hostname _(refer [connecting-local-db](connecting-local-db.md) to connect to the database running on the localhost)_
        - Database port
        - Database name
        - Database username _(should exist and be a `SUPERUSER` [more info](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-createrole.html))_
        - Database password

- If installing on Windows, you need to have [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) installed first and [Turn on wsl-2 in docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/#turn-on-docker-desktop-wsl-2)


## Install using the interactive script {#guided}

!!! info "Installation Script Overview"
    The interactive script will set up a database server, the Mathesar web server, an upgrade server for upgrading using the UI, and a reverse proxy. If you want to customize the setup process, please look at the [Manual Install section](#manual)


1. Paste this command into your terminal to begin installing the latest version of Mathesar:

    ```sh
    bash <(curl -sfSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/centerofci/mathesar/0.1.1/install.sh)
    ```

1. Follow the interactive prompts to configure your Mathesar installation.

1. When finished, the installer will display the URL where you can run Mathesar from your web browser.

!!! note "Connecting to a local database"
    Once you have successfully installed Mathesar, if you wish to connect it to an existing database that is running locally on the host machine, you can refer to the following [guide](./connecting-local-db.md).

!!! info "Getting help"
    If you run into any problems during installation, see [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) or [open a ticket describing your problem](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/new/choose).


## Manual Install {#manual}

1. Navigate to a directory where you'd like to store your Mathesar configuration. By convention, we do it within `/etc/mathesar`, but it can be a different directory if you like.

    ```
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/mathesar
    cd /etc/mathesar
    ```

1. Download our [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/raw/master/docker-compose.yml), and [.env.example](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/raw/master/.env.example) files to your configuration directory.

    ```
    wget https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/raw/master/docker-compose.yml
    wget https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/raw/master/.env.example
    ```

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`

    ```
    mv .env.example .env
    ```

    Your custom `.env` file will be used for setting [configuration variables](../configuration.md).

1. Set up the web server.

    1. Edit your `.env` file, making the following changes:

        - Add the [**Backend Configuration** environment variables](../configuration.md#backend)
        - Add the [**Database Configuration** environment variables](../configuration.md#database)
        - Customize the values of the environment variables to suit your needs.

        !!! example
            Your `.env` file should look something like this
            
            ``` bash
            POSTGRES_USER='mathesar'
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD='mathesar'
            POSTGRES_PORT='5432'
            ALLOWED_HOSTS='https://<your_domain_name>'
            SECRET_KEY='dee551f449ce300ee457d339dcee9682eb1d6f96b8f28feda5283aaa1a21'
            DJANGO_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://mathesar:mathesar@mathesar_db:5432/mathesar_django'
            MATHESAR_DATABASES='(mathesar_tables|postgresql://mathesar:mathesar@mathesar_db:5432/mathesar)'
            DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD='password'
            ```

    1. If you only plan to use Mathesar to connect to other preexisting Postgres database servers, then you may choose to [disable Mathesar's inbuilt Postgres database service](#disable-db-service) if you like. (Skip this step if you want to use Mathesar's Postgres database service.)

    1. Start the Mathesar web server.

        === "Linux"
            ```
            sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up service -d
            ```

        === "MacOS"
            ```
            docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up service -d
            ```

1. Set up the Caddy reverse proxy.

    1. Edit your `.env` file, adding the [**Caddy Reverse Proxy** environment variables](../configuration.md#caddy).
    
    1. Start the Caddy reverse proxy

        === "Linux"
            ```
            sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up caddy-reverse-proxy -d
            ```

        === "MacOS"
            ```
            docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up caddy-reverse-proxy -d
            ```

1. (Optional) Start the Upgrade server to enable upgrading the docker image using the Mathesar UI.

    === "Linux"
        ```
        sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up watchtower -d
        ```

    === "MacOS"
        ```
        docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up watchtower -d
        ```


## Administration

### Start/stop the server {:#start-stop}

The Mathesar server needs to be running for you to use Mathesar. If you restart your machine, you'll need to start the server again.

- **Start** Mathesar:

    === "Linux"
        ```
        sudo docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml up -d
        ```

    === "MacOS"
        ```
        docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml up -d
        ```

- **Stop** Mathesar:

    === "Linux"
        ```
        sudo docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml down
        ```

    === "MacOS"
        ```
        docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml down
        ```

    This stops all Mathesar Docker containers and releases their ports.

!!! note
    If you customized the Mathesar configuration directory during installation, you'll need to change `/etc/mathesar` to your configuration directory.

### Upgrade

!!! tip "Upgrade from within Mathesar"
    You can also run the upgrade from within Mathesar by logging in as an admin user and navigating to "Administration" (in the top right menu) > "Software Update"

Manually upgrade Mathesar to the newest version using watch tower:

=== "Linux"
    ```
    sudo docker exec mathesar-watchtower-1 /watchtower --run-once
    ```

=== "MacOS"
    ```
    docker exec mathesar-watchtower-1 /watchtower --run-once
    ```

Manually upgrade Mathesar to the newest version without using watch tower:

=== "Linux"
    ```
    sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --force-recreate --build service
    ```

=== "MacOS"
    ```
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --force-recreate --build service
    ```

### Uninstall

1. Remove all Mathesar Docker images and containers.

    === "Linux"
        ```
        sudo docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml down --rmi all -v
        ```

    === "MacOS"
        ```
        docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml down --rmi all -v
        ```

1. Remove configuration files.

    ```sh
    sudo rm -rf /etc/mathesar
    ```

    !!! note
        If you customized the Mathesar configuration directory during installation, you'll need to change `/etc/mathesar` to your configuration directory.

1. Remove Mathesar internal schemas.

    **If you connected Mathesar to an existing database**, the installation process would have created a new schema for Mathesar's use. You can remove this schema from that database as follows:

    1. Connect to the database.

        ```
        psql -h <DB HOSTNAME> -p <DB PORT> -U <DB_USER> <DB_NAME>
        ```

    2. Delete the schema.

        ```postgresql
        DROP SCHEMA mathesar_types CASCADE;
        ```

        !!! danger 
            Deleting this schema will also delete any database objects that depend on it. This should not be an issue if you don't have any data using Mathesar's custom data types.

## Customization

### Start Mathesar without the database server {#disable-db-service}

The default `docker-compose.yml` has a `db` service which automatically starts a Postgres database server container called `mathesar_db`. This service allows you to immediately start using Mathesar to store data in a Postgres database without administering a separate Postgres server outside of Mathesar. But if you only plan to use Mathesar to connect to other Postgres servers, then you may disable Mathesar's inbuilt Postgres service if you like.

In the `docker-compose.yml` file, comment out the `db` service from the `depends_on` field of the `service`.

```yaml hl_lines="10 11"
services:
  # ...
  service:
    # ...
    volumes:
      - static:/code/static
      - media:/code/media
    depends_on:
      # Comment the below field to disable starting the database service automatically
      # db:
      #  condition: service_healthy
```

After this change, Mathesar will no longer start the `db` service automatically.

### Run Mathesar on a non-standard HTTP port {#non-standard-port}

By default, Caddy serves the Mathesar web application on a port as determined by the protocol within your [`DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable](../configuration.md#domain_name).

- For `http` domain names it uses  port `80`.
- For `https` domain names (as is the default, if not specified) it uses port `443`. In this case Caddy also creates an SSL certificate [automatically](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#activation).

    !!! warning
        Caddy won't be able to verify the SSL certificate when running on a non-standard port, so make sure you already have a reverse proxy that handles SSL.

To use a non-standard port:

1. Edit your `.env` file and set either the [`HTTP_PORT`](../configuration.md#http_port) or the [`HTTPS_PORT`](../configuration.md#https_port) environment variable (depending on the protocol you're using).

    !!! example
        To serve Mathesar at `http://localhost:9000`, include the following in your `.env` file:

        ```bash
        DOMAIN_NAME='http://localhost'
        HTTP_PORT=9000
        ```

1. Restart the container 

    === "Linux"
        ```
        sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up caddy-reverse-proxy -d
        ```

    === "MacOS"
        ```
        docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up caddy-reverse-proxy -d
        ```
